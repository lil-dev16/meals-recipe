### Built with

### What I learned

```js
import {useContext} from 'react'
import {useEffect} from 'react'
import {useState} from 'react'

localStorage.setItem("favourites", JSON.stringify(newFavs))

const {data} = await axios(url)
```
I learned more about the react hooks, a lot about local storage and axios  with this project
Most importantly I know how to manage state better now with ContextAPI
